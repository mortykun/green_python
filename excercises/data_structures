============================================================
Given a list slice it into a 3 equal chunks and rever each list
DATA
sampleList = [11, 45, 8, 23, 14, 12, 78, 45, 89]
RESULT:
Original list  [11, 45, 8, 23, 14, 12, 78, 45, 89]
Chunk  1 [11, 45, 8]
After reversing it  [8, 45, 11]
Chunk  2 [23, 14, 12]
After reversing it  [12, 14, 23]
Chunk  3 [78, 45, 89]
After reversing it  [89, 45, 78]
============================================================
Given a list iterate it and count the occurrence of each element and create a dictionary to show the count of each element
DATA
original_list =  [11, 45, 8, 11, 23, 45, 23, 45, 89]
RESULT
Printing count of each item   {11: 2, 45: 3, 8: 1, 23: 2, 89: 1}
============================================================
Iterate a given list and Check if a given element already exists in a dictionary as a keyâ€™s value if is - delete it from the list
DATA:
rollNumber = [47, 64, 69, 37, 76, 83, 95, 97]
sampleDict ={'Jhon':47, 'Emma':69, 'Kelly':76, 'Jason':97}
RESULT:
[64, 37, 83, 95]
==================
Remove duplicate from a list and create a tuple and find the minimum and maximum number
DATA
sampleList = [87, 45, 41, 65, 94, 41, 99, 94]
RESULT
unique items [87, 45, 41, 65, 99]
tuple (87, 45, 41, 65, 99)
min: 41
max: 99
